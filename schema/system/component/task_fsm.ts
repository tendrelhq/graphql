  // cannot be refetched! Perhaps we can allow for it by way of `parent` though,
  // i.e. when a Task (worktemplate underlying) is refetched, its fsm is
  // actually a connection that represents *all active chains*, regardless of
  // location. We can add an argument to the connection that would allow us to
  // filter these chains based on their parent (e.g. Location). This is ends up
  // being rather ergonomically awkward since, in practice, you will be
  // accessing Task.fsm within some other "trackable hierarchy", e.g. Location.
